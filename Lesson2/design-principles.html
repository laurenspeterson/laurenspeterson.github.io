                <p class="explanation"> Pinterest is a good example of Fitt's Law. 
                    Everything is in a convienient location and can be reached relatively
                     easy. If you are holding the phone in your right hand, it is not 
                     difficult to tap any of the images that you would like to pin or to 
                     seach for something with the search bar.</p>

            <h3>Alignment</h3>

            <p class="explanation">This website uses good alignment. 
                Everything is aligned nicely and the website is very 
                symmetrical which creates a nice and organized feel. 
                I like that they used two pictures at the top to match 
                what they did at the bottom with the listed clothing pictures.</p>

            <h4>Contrast</h4>
            <p><a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/"> Spotify.com</a></p>
            <img src="images/spotifyscreenshot.png"> 
            <p class="explanation">Spotify's current design shows
                 bright contrasting colors which really draws people 
                 in and creates interest in the page. It makes the page
                  look fun and intrigues more people to use it by 
                  striking their eyes. It makes it more exciting, which
                   is what a music website should be.</p>
